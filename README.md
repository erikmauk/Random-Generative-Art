# Random-Generative-Art
Computational Art: Lab 4 (Randomly Generated Stars)

In this lab, I created a function for one single star and had a for loop make many iterations of these stars.

The stars are generated over this for loop with a random fill color, stroke, size, and opacity.
Every time this is ran, a different arrangement of stars appears. But, being that the stars are all the same shape,
there is still an element of structure in a somewhat chaotic scene.

Within this repository, you will find a demo video of the final product attached. Enjoy!
